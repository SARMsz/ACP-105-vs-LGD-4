<h1>ACP-105 vs LGD-4: My Results, Side Effects & Which One’s Better</h1>

<p>I’ve tested almost every SARM you can name, but this match-up between <strong>ACP-105</strong> and <strong>LGD-4</strong> surprised me. These two compounds are similar in some ways, but give very different results depending on your goal — size, strength, or staying lean.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll break down what happened when I ran full 6-week solo cycles of each one. No stacks, no extra gear — just diet, training, and real SARMs.</p>

<p><strong>Want to try them yourself?</strong> I only use Chemyo for purity-tested SARMs. These are the exact ones I ran:</p>

<h2>What Are ACP-105 and LGD-4?</h2>

<h3>ACP-105</h3>
<p>ACP-105 is a newer SARM that’s known for giving good strength and lean mass gains, but without much suppression. It’s one of the lighter SARMs, so it’s a popular pick for cutting or beginners. It binds selectively to androgen receptors in muscle and bone — not in the prostate or brain like testosterone does.</p>

<h3>LGD-4</h3>
<p>LGD-4 is basically an improved version of LGD-4033 (Ligandrol). It hits harder for size and strength but tries to reduce some of the suppression LGD-4033 is known for. Still, it’s a big gun — not something you’d want to mess with if you’re not ready for a stronger cycle.</p>

<h2>How I Tested Them</h2>

<p>Same protocol for both:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cycle length: 6 weeks</li>
  <li>Training: 5 days/week, push-pull-legs split</li>
  <li>Diet: Maintenance calories, high protein</li>
  <li>Supplements: Just creatine and fish oil</li>
  <li>Bloodwork pre and post (yes, I’m that guy)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ran ACP-105 first, took 4 weeks off, then ran LGD-4 solo. Here’s what happened.</p>

<h2>My ACP-105 Results</h2>

<p>I took 20mg/day of ACP-105. By week 2.5, I started noticing a small bump in gym endurance and some nice muscle pumps. Strength slowly increased — nothing wild, but steady. I gained about 2.5 lbs total and got noticeably leaner.</p>

<p>What stood out most was how clean it felt. No crash, no mood swings, no libido issues. I didn’t need PCT and bloodwork showed minimal suppression. Recovery was better than normal, and I felt more “on” in the gym — more drive, tighter muscles.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, lean gains, recomposition</p>

<p><strong>Dose I used:</strong> 20mg/day</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No suppression for me</li>
  <li>Lean, dry muscle gain</li>
  <li>Good strength and endurance boost</li>
  <li>Easy on the body, no crash</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gains are slower than stronger SARMs</li>
  <li>Not ideal for bulking</li>
</ul>

<h2>My LGD-4 Results</h2>

<p>LGD-4 was a different beast. I ran it at 10mg/day and noticed strength gains by the end of week 1. By week 3, my muscles looked fuller, and my weight was up 6 lbs — solid size, not fluff. Pumps were insane. I set PRs in deadlift and overhead press that cycle.</p>

<p>But I also felt some suppression kick in by week 5. Libido dipped, and I felt a little foggy. I ran a light PCT afterward, and bloods bounced back fine. Side effects were mild but noticeable.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, strength, fast size gains</p>

<p><strong>Dose I used:</strong> 10mg/day</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fast size and strength gains</li>
  <li>Great for bulking or recomposition</li>

<h2>ACP-105 vs LGD-4: Which One Wins?</h2>

<p><strong>LGD-4 wins</strong> if you want maximum muscle gain and strength fast. It hits hard and delivers, but you’ll need to plan for recovery (PCT).</p>

<p><strong>ACP-105 wins</strong> if you want to stay lean, avoid suppression, or you're just starting out. It’s easier on your body and gives great results with fewer risks.</p>

<p>Usually no, especially under 6 weeks. Always check bloodwork to be sure.</p>

<h3>Is ACP-105 safer than LGD-4?</h3>
<p>Yes. It has fewer side effects and less hormonal impact.</p>

<h3>Can I stack them?</h3>
<p>Yes, but only if you’ve used each one solo before. Start low, monitor closely.</p>

<h3>Which one has better pumps?</h3>
<p>LGD-4 easily. Pumps and fullness were crazy after week 2.</p>

<h3>How long are cycles?</h3>
<p>Both should be 6–8 weeks max. LGD-4 needs post-cycle therapy. ACP-105 usually doesn’t.</p>

<h3>Where can I buy real SARMs?</h3>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If you're trying to stay lean, boost performance, or dip your toes into SARMs without crashing your system, <strong>ACP-105 is the better pick</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re going full-send on mass and strength, and you’ve done SARMs before, <strong>LGD-4 is a monster</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ll keep using both in the right situations. Just don’t cheap out — buy tested SARMs and track your health like it matters (because it does).</p>

<p><strong>Train smart. Grow hard.</strong></p>
